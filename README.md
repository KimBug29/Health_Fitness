# Health_Fitness

## Created by Kim Wolf

Health and Fitness Relationship is a data analysis project with a focus on comparing and contrasting fitness activity to select health indicators. Activity measurement originated from fitness trackers, a sports logging app and manual data entry from participants.


## Technologies Used
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): Version xx.x
* [Juypter Notebook in Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/): Version x.xx   
* [______](https://example.com): Version 1234

## General Info - Project Description
***
 * The data analysis project was written in VS Code with Jupyter notebook and ______ for data visualization. 
 
 uses pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform various analysis of two (or more) data sets. Data visualization uses ______ still to be determined (options include Tableau/Jupyter/Plotly or Matplotlib)
 * While constructing this project I faced ______ (challenges)


 ## Project Features

 Health and Fitness Relationship project includes the following features.

 * Feature 1 - Load data. Read two (or more) data files including csv, Excel and JSON
 * Feature 2 - Clean data while combining. Clean data and perform a pandas merge with two (or more) data sets, then calculates some new values based on the new data set
 * Feature 3 - Visualize data. .....  still to be determined
 * Feature 4 - Best practices. Utilize a virtual environment, instructions included in this README
 * Feature 5 - Interpretation of data. Use of markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, including clear code comments, and well written README.md 



## Installation (example)
***
A little intro about the installation. 
```
$ git clone https://example.com
$ cd ../path/to/the/file
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Note: To use the application in a special environment use ```lorem ipsum``` to start.


## Installation 

Use the package manager [pip] (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Python

_______ insert instructions on how to get the development environment set and running.

KEEP THE BELOW INFO AND USE AS REFERENCE WHILE WORKING ON PROJECT

Guide to using markdown for README.md files (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

At a minimum, the program should ingest, analyze, and display data. Any needed data cleaning should be clearly documented and repeatable.

Provide clear descriptions of what your code does and why you’re doing it!

Visualize / Present your data. In addition to matplotlib and seaborn, you might use Tableau or a pandas pivot table to summarize your data. Imagine you have to present your data to your future manager or in an interview. They should be able to understand what you’re trying to present relatively quickly without having knowledge of  how you programmed it. 

Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.
 
Make a Tableau dashboard to display your data
 
Make at least 1 Pandas pivot table and 1 matplotlib/seaborn plot. Pivot tables are a way to summarize your data and present it easily in a way that isn’t just a graph. They can be useful when combined with graphs.

Best practices: 

Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up

conda virtual environments (note: you can do this with a few different modules, so either venv or virtualenv are fine as well) 

Write 3 unit tests and include instructions on how the user can run them. This will mostly only apply if you’re building custom functions and classes.
 
Build a custom data dictionary and include it either in your README or as a separate document. This will only apply if your data set does not already have a data dictionary or if you’re building a custom data set. For an example, see the resources to the right.

Data Dictionary example (look under the 6th row on this Louisville Metro Data data set) 
Any other “best practices” your mentor can think of: this is open to interpretation, but if your mentor has a particular idea for a best practice about your specific project, that will meet the requirement for this table.

Interpretation of your data. This requires no code but is VERY important. You’re going to be practicing your written skills here, which is an essential job skill. You can just say “clear communication skills” on a resume, you have to prove it to them. We want few grammatical errors, good markdown formatting where relevant, and explanations of why you’re coding what you’re coding. When you read through the class work-through project HERE you can see what I’m thinking because of how I have things written in the markdown cells above and below the code. Obviously, you will have grammatical and formatting errors, that’s human. But if someone that’s not super familiar with Python or your project picks it up, they should be able to make sense of it relatively quickly. This last box is a “polishing” step to make sure everything is tidy and ready to present to an employer. 

Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don’t have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.
